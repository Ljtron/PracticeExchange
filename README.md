# Practice Exchange Project

## Description

The practice exchange project is adopted from the truffle tutorial BUILDING ROBUST SMART CONTRACTS WITH [OPENZEPPELIN](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/robust-smart-contracts-with-openzeppelin). This tutorial teaches you how to make an ERC20 token using openzeppelin within your smart contract. They also show you how to upload your contract to a test ethereum blockchain.

## Edits

One of the edits I made within the truffle tutorial was I created another ERC20 token called Ljtron token with a symbol of LJ. I created a smart contract and imported the openzeppelin ERC20.sol file.

Another edit I made was I gave the user the ability to choose another token other than the TT token. I gave the user the ability to use the token I made and when they click the ljtronContract the user will see his/her balance of LJs.
